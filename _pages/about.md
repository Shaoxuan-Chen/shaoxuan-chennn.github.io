I am currently a fourth-year PhD candidate in Department of Mathematics & Statistics, University of Massachusetts Amherst and visiting Ph.D. student in School of Mathematics, Georgia Institute of Technology. Iâ€™m fortunate to be asvised by Prof. Wei Zhu and Prof. Panayotis Kevrekidis. My research interests are primarily focus on Physics Machine Learning, Meta Learning and Diffusion Models. Before PhD, I got my M.A. and M.S. degrees from Boston University and Columbia University respectively.
